## StatsAndroidApp

This is an Android app that consumes the Statistcs web service provided by RotasWebApp.

## How to build
This source code needs to be built by the Android SDK; then the app must be installed on the phone using the SDK (later the app will be made available on the Android marketplace).

## How to use it
After the installation on the phone or tablet is complete, enter a month and year for which statistics are to be retrieved.
That's when the Android app invokes the Rotas Web App's statistics web service and displays the JSON data obtained from that call.
